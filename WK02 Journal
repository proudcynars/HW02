I am working on my thesis with this matter so
I am experimenting on teachable machine and p5 
and also integrated it with stable diffusion 
through proxy.

Working: 
It detects fairly well on the object and super easy to use

NOt working :
The image classifier can only classified 
one object at the time and it would be better 
to have a control environment in order to train it.

Also when the objects are lack of colors contrast or 
have some what similar feature it is finicky 

Interface: 
This are the result of my thesis progress. I havet work much on the interface.
I am doing it for the people who wanted to create their own "space".
so the input will be physical and running the process using AI and result in GenAI
